## What is flutter leap of faith

Flutter leap of faith workshop is an introductory workshop to the flutter software development environment to drive the young minds to this latest cross platform technology to build mobile and web apps faster and conveniently.

You should setup your computer acccoding to the below instructions to properly follow up with the workshop.
The sample code base used during the workshop can be found here in this [repository](https://jekyllrb.com/).

### Why leap of faith
Flutter is still new and young, but a trending technology with a huge potential, developed by the Google's flutter team. We clearly don't know how far the technology will expand or how much it will be used in industry applications in the future except for the part that this is the one of the best technologies so far to build cross platform mobile apps and the biggest competitor for react native. Additionaly flutter has gone extra lengths to make the platform available for both web and desktop.
